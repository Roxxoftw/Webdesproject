	<p class="subtitles">This was made because I plan on sending this to my friend who want to get into FF14.</p>
	<p class="subtitles2">This was also a project for my subject in WEBDES handled by Prof. Abraham Magpantay at FEU Institute of Technology</p>
	<p class="header2c">Design choices</p>
	<p class="subtitles2">The design that I chose at first was filled with images and backgrounds but I was told<br>that a simple white background for a simple guide would be better, as it also helps this guide to be a quick alt tab guide when playing.</p>
	<p class="header2c">Targeted Levels</p>
		<p class="subtitles2">This guide is only useful for level 1-50. Beyond that the game gets harder and this only serves as a general guide<br> and not a class specific guide. There are tons of guides for specific classes out there. Use those for learning a specific class.</p>

	<p class="subtitles">I would give my special thanks to my Professor, Abraham Magpantay who has properly thought us about HTML and web design basics.	<br><br>All the content here was either made by Jeffrey Barrios, or was taken from other sources. I would also like to thank my friends who helped<br>
	make this mini guide possible. A special shoutout to Arvan Malabanan who was also in the videos that I took. <br>
