	<p class="subtitles">Emnity, also known as threat or hate, is a mechanic that causes the enemy monsters to target and attack a player. <br>When multiple players are attacking an enemy, enemy A.I. will target the player with the highest enmity. <br>Players increase their enmity by attacking, healing or performing specific enmity increasing actions. <br>Basically Emnity how much attention enemies are giving you.<br><br> As a tank you will always want to have every mobs' attention.</p>

	<p class="subtitles2">The bar will fill up as you attract enemy attention. When your emnity bar has the letter A on it, that means you are the target! <br>You will need to maintain this emnity level though, as healers' abilities also generate emnity such as the White Mage's Cure.</p><br>

	<p class="subtitles"> Something that you should know as a tank is generating and maintaining aggro. <br>Not having aggro on you on all times would result in mobs getting scattered and <br>Having all mobs attack multiple party members at once which <br>is a real bad situation for you and your healer

	<img class="center" src="assets/tanks/Pulling.PNG" width="75%">
	
	<p class="subtitles2">As you can see in the infographic, you have to use your emnity generator at least 2 times. Keeping an eye on the emnity bar<br> will also give you an indication on when you should recast your emnity generators.<br><br><img src="assets/tanks/Aggro.PNG"><br><br>This should help you discern what those icons mean when you pull mobs.</p>
	
	<p class="header2c">Positioning</p>
	<p class="subtitles2">Now that you've successfully pulled all these mobs, you now have to position them properly. <br> Most of the time you need to face the mobs away from your party so when AOEs hit they will be faced away<br> from the party. When ranged mobs are present, there are certain things to do to make it an efficient pull.</p>

		<p class="subtitles2">So, as a tank, remember that you're job is to lead your party. You need to initiate, create aggro, and maintain aggro. <br>Position properly and you're group will have an easier time. Pull big if you can but ask your healer if he/she can keep up with you. <br>
		Also use your role skills while keeping the cooldown in mind, use them with efficiency in mind.</p>
